I’m really ready to start a career path in software development…….. it’s been an amazing journey so far and I have learnt a whole lot in the past 6 months thanks to my instructors Mr Usman Oni and Mr Ayodeji Atanda………. And he have been really supportive and helpful and they’ve also thought me a lot…… with also providing extra materials to learn.
They’ve also advised me on many things including approaches to solving problems and advices on how things work in the tech space 

The skills I have gained in GoMyCode bootcamp are…
HTML, css, JavaScript, React, expressJs 
I have literally become a MERN stack developer in the space of 6 months thanks to the conducive GoMyCode environment
